            Healthcare professionals and users guide NUVA's development. We actively seek 
            feedback from doctors, pharmacists, and patients to understand what works, 
            what doesn't, and what features would be most valuable. Development priorities 
            are based on real medical needs.

          <p>
            As NUVA grows, we will add new capabilities and medical specialties gradually. 
            Each expansion will be implemented with the same careful attention to safety, 
            accuracy, and ethical boundaries. We will not rush to add features that could 
            compromise quality or safety.

            NUVA's future development will involve ongoing collaboration with medical 
            professionals in Kurdistan and beyond. We believe that effective medical AI 
            must be built in partnership with the healthcare community, not in isolation.

            As NUVA evolves, our commitment to medical ethics remains constant. Every new 
            feature will be evaluated not just for technical capability, but for its impact 
            on patient safety, medical practice, and healthcare outcomes. Responsible development 
            is not optional.

            and responsibly with input from the medical community.
